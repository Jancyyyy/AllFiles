	Node

	design pattern
	framework
	platform / runtime

	
	Execute java code within the browser?
		plugin - applet
	Execute C# / VB.net within the browser?
		plugin - silverlight


	Execute javascript code within the browser

				-	Runtime / Platform
	JAVA	on the machine	JVM - Java Virtual Machine
	C#	on the machine	CLR - Common Language Runtime
	C, C++  on the machine	C Runtime 

	Javascript	on the machine		node.exe

	download the node conceptually 3 things
	
	node.exe - runtime
	node.js - SDK/ JDK / FCL
	npm  - Node Package Manager


	npm to install / uninstall packages
	
	yarn
	bower - to manage only client side packages
		e.g.  node-sass, Angular

			

	Architecture Pattern

	n-tier / n-layer arch pattern

	3-tier

	PL	BL	DAL

			queries to access the data
			class
				methods
			unit testing
	
			ORM - Object Relational Mapping

			you code against object that has a mapping with table of RDBMS
		
		Java - ORM - Hibernate
		C#, VB.net - ORM - Entity Framework
		Javascript / Node - No SQL - MongoDB - ODM - Mongoose

		What about unit testing of BL
			libraries, .dll, .lib set of classes
			easily do the unit testing

		PL - you don't do unit testing of Presentation

		UI + UI Logic

		What about independent unit testing of UI Logic
		ans NO - button click handler needs to have button object
		- so you need to go mocking
	

	Separation of Concern
	TDD - Test Driven Development	

	MVC - Model View Controller

	Model - Data Entity
	View - Representation of that Data
	Controller - first class citizen - push model's data to the view
		and also handles events associated with controls which are
		there on the view.

	Client Server Arch - Web App / Web Site - MVC

	
	MVP - Model View Presenter - Thick Client

		View has a ref to Presenter and vice versa
	MVPM - Model View Presenter Model
	works almost same like MVC

	
	Microsoft has adopted MVPM and come up with another pattern called as
	
	MVVM - Model View ViewModel

	Wherever you have support for 
		Data Binding & 
		Commands you go for MVVM
	Object that invoke the command and object that execute the command

	Prism,WPF, Silverlight


		MVC - Arch Pattern
		MVC is being implemented
		Java	- Spring
		.Net	- Asp.net MVC
		Node	- Express

	
	Node - Single threaded, fast, scalable, Event Driven Programming.

	Module Formats

	Node - CommonJS
	
	export - module.exports
	import - require() - CommonJS require function
