1--Destructuring is an efficient way to extract multiple values from data 
that is stored in arrays or objects.

2--The map. set() method is used to add key-value pairs to a Map object.
 It can also be used to update the value of an existing key. Each value 
 must have a unique key so that they get mapped correctly.

Maps, the data is stored as a key-value pair
Sets, data is a single collection of values that are unique

3--Generator which can stop midway and then continue from where it stopped.
They can create iterable objects. they can be paused and resumed at any point.
-is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using a yield statement
-Iterators are the objects that use the next() method to get the next value 
 of the sequence.

 Async keyword is used along with the function declaration which specifies that this function is now able to accept all types of asynchronous events on itself.
In other words, the async keyword is used along with functions (or methods) which enables them to receive all types of asynchronous data easily.
Async keyword usage along with the functions always returns a promise at the end along with its state (pending or resolved or rejected).
Await is used inside the async function which is though useful for the waiting purpose of the result.
Await basically waits for the results which are particularly to be fetched from the source from which that async function is about to fetch the data.
Await takes a little time to fetch the results from the source (like API) and thereafter along with the async function returns the result in the form of a promise.
Await can also be used if Async is used along with the function declaration.
