what are ways to async programming in es5

Static variable: A static variable in JavaScript is basically a 
property of the class which is not used on the object of the 
class but is used in the class itself.

Constant: A constant variable in JavaScript is a variable that 
has a constant or a fixed value which remains the same ie. 
which does not change throughout the program.

Both of them are used to share the benaviour and data from multiple objects.
-prototype is used to access the prototype of a function using function.
-It is a property of the class
Eg:Syntax: (function.prototype)
 
-proto is used to access the prototype of a function using the object
-It is the property of the instance of that class.
-It is also called dunder proto.
Eg:Syntax: (object.__proto__)

Ajax is used to update the page asynchronously by updating only a
 particular part of  the webpage instead of reloading the whole page.

In RESTFUL web service HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE 
can be used to perform CRUD operations.

GET: It requests a resource at the request URL. It should not contain a request 
  body as it will be discarded. Maybe it can be cached locally or on the server.
POST: It submits information to the service for processing; it should typically
  return the modified or new resource
PUT: At the request URL it update the resource
DELETE: At the request URL it removes the resource
 
json-it stands for javascript object notation,it is used to store and 
transfer data in a lightweight format,it is often used to 
transfer data from server to the webpage
